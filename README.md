This project is a simple yet interactive running game where a red box (player) must jump to avoid a green box (obstacle). The player uses the spacebar to jump, and the game tracks the score, which increases each time the player avoids the obstacle. If the player collides with the obstacle, the game ends, displaying a "Game Over" message along with the final score. A restart button then appears, allowing the player to reset the game and try again. Additionally, the footer dynamically displays the creator's name and the current year, providing a personal touch. The game's logic and visuals are implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
